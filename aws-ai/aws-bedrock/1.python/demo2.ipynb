       "Once upon a time, there was a mother cat and her young kittens by the name of Timmy and Puss. They all lived in the forest together, and the mother cat was a good hunter and a very caring mother. One day, a group of hunters came into the forest and started killing animals. The mother cat and her kittens were very scared because they had nowhere to go. They decided to hide in the bushes until the hunters left. After a few hours, the hunters left and the mother cat and her kittens came out of the bushes. They were very happy to see that they were still alive. From that day on, they lived in the forest happily ever after."
