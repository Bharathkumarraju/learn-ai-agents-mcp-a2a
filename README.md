## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

A protocol or interface that defines how information (context) is structured, sent, and used when interacting with an AI model - especially multi-turn, tool-using, or agent-like systems.

Modern AI models need context to do intelligent reasoning. MCP helps organize this context in a structured, extensible way:

- What was previously said? (conversation history)  
- What tools are available? (tool/function metadata)  
- What actions were taken? (and their outputs)  
- What the model is expected to do next?  

Using **Cline** with an MCP server, we can get a structured AI agent that can:  
- Reason step-by-step  
- Use tools  
- Remember context  
- Be inspected, versioned, and improved
